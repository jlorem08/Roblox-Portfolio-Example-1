# Temporary Portfolio Code

Hello! I am @noxiralith on Discord and @p_rceptionnull on Roblox. I have been scripting for just about 6 years, but I've just recently settled down on this account (I've been an account hopper for quite a long time). This code is not the complete source code for a game I've been working on, but is enough to show that I am capable of organizing my thoughts in ways that other developers should be able to read and work upon.
